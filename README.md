## Setup Instructions

### 1. Google Apps Script Setup
1. Create a new Google Apps Script project
2. Copy the contents of `Code.gs` to your script
3. Add `Index.html` as an HTML file
4. Deploy as a web application

### 2. Google Sheets Setup
1. Create a new Google Spreadsheet
2. Create the required sheets: Record, Member, Area, Store, Product
3. Populate the Member, Area, Store, and Product sheets with your data
4. Note the spreadsheet ID from the URL

### 3. Script Properties Configuration
Set the following script properties in Google Apps Script:

```
SpreadSheet_ID: Your Google Sheets ID
Record_Sheet_Name: Name of your main record sheet
Member_Sheet_Name: Name of your member sheet (default: 'Member')

2. Create an API key
3. Add the API key to script properties

### 5. Web App Deployment
1. Deploy the script as a web application
2. Set execute permissions appropriately
3. Copy the web app URL
4. Update the URL in `Index.html` (replace 'YOUR_DEPLOYED_WEB_APP_URL')

## Usage

1. Access the deployed web application URL
2. Fill in all required fields:
   - Select your name from the dropdown
   - Choose the area
   - Select store and branch
   - Add general notes if needed
   - In the Product Sales section, select or modify the sampling date (defaults to today, common to all products)
   - Use product tabs to enter sales data for each product (at least one required)
   - For each product: enter sales counts, sampling counts, and product notes
3. Optionally, add sampling activities:
   - Click "+ Add Sampling Activity" to add a new entry
   - Select product (optional), enter cups served and sample bottles used
   - Can add multiple sampling activities
   - Click the Ã— button to remove an activity
4. Click "Register" to submit the data
5. The system will automatically capture your location and save all data to the spreadsheet

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests. To run tests:

```javascript
// Run all tests
runAllTests()

// Run specific test categories
testGetMemberList()
testGetAreaList()
testGetStoreList()
testDoPostValidInput()

// Setup test configuration
setupTestProperties()
```
